We want to go to the cinema.
A good film is playing today.
The film is brand new.
Where is the cash register?
Are seats still available?
How much are the admission tickets?
When does the show begin?
How long is the film?
Can one reserve tickets?
I want to sit at the back.
I want to sit at the front.
I want to sit in the middle.
The film was exciting.
The film was not boring.
But the book on which the film was based was better.
How was the music?
How were the actors?
Were there English subtitles?
