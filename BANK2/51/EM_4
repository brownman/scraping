Do you exercise?
Yes, I need some exercise.
I am a member of a sports club.
We play football / soccer (am.).
We swim sometimes.
Or we cycle.
There is a football / soccer (am.) stadium in our city.
There is also a swimming pool with a sauna.
And there is a golf course.
What is on TV?
There is a football / soccer (am.) match on now.
The German team is playing against the English one.
Who is winning?
I have no idea.
It is currently a tie.
The referee is from Belgium.
Now there is a penalty.
Goal! One â€“ zero!
