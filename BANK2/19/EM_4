Our house is here.
The roof is on top.
The basement is below.
There is a garden behind the house.
There is no street in front of the house.
There are trees next to the house.
My apartment is here.
The kitchen and bathroom are here.
The living room and bedroom are there.
The front door is closed.
But the windows are open.
It is hot today.
We are going to the living room.
There is a sofa and an armchair there.
Please, sit down!
My computer is there.
My stereo is there.
The TV set is brand new.
