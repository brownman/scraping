Is this seat taken?
May I sit with you?
Sure.
How do you like the music?
A little too loud.
But the band plays very well.
Do you come here often?
No, this is the first time.
I’ve never been here before.
Would you like to dance?
Maybe later.
I can’t dance very well.
It’s very easy.
I’ll show you.
No, maybe some other time.
Are you waiting for someone?
Yes, for my boyfriend.
There he is!
