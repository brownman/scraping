I don’t know if he loves me.
I don’t know if he’ll come back.
I don’t know if he’ll call me.
Maybe he doesn’t love me?
Maybe he won’t come back?
Maybe he won’t call me?
I wonder if he thinks about me.
I wonder if he has someone else.
I wonder if he lies.
Maybe he thinks of me?
Maybe he has someone else?
Maybe he tells me the truth?
I doubt whether he really likes me.
I doubt whether he’ll write to me.
I doubt whether he’ll marry me.
Does he really like me?
Will he write to me?
Will he marry me?
