to write
He wrote a letter.
And she wrote a card.
to read
He read a magazine.
And she read a book.
to take
He took a cigarette.
She took a piece of chocolate.
He was disloyal, but she was loyal.
He was lazy, but she was hard-working.
He was poor, but she was rich.
He had no money, only debts.
He had no luck, only bad luck.
He had no success, only failure.
He was not satisfied, but dissatisfied.
He was not happy, but sad.
He was not friendly, but unfriendly.
