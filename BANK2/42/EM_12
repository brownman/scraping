Excuse me!
Can you help me?
Is there a good restaurant around here?
Take a left at the corner.
Then go straight for a while.

You can also take the bus.
You can also take the tram.
You can also follow me with your car.
How do I get to the football / soccer (am.) stadium?
Cross the bridge!
Go through the tunnel!
Drive until you reach the third traffic light.

Then drive straight through the next intersection.
Excuse me, how do I get to the airport?
It is best if you take the underground / subway (am.).
Simply get out at the last stop.
