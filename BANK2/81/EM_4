I am wearing a blue dress.
I am wearing a red dress.
I am wearing a green dress.
I’m buying a black bag.
I’m buying a brown bag.
I’m buying a white bag.
I need a new car.
I need a fast car.
I need a comfortable car.

A fat lady lives at the top.
A curious lady lives below.
Our guests were nice people.
Our guests were polite people.
Our guests were interesting people.
I have lovely children.
