What do you do for a living?
My husband is a doctor.
I work as a nurse part-time.
We will soon receive our pension.
But taxes are high.
And health insurance is expensive.
What would you like to become some day?
I would like to become an engineer.
I want to go to college.
I am an intern.
I do not earn much.
I am doing an internship abroad.
That is my boss.
I have nice colleagues.
We always go to the cafeteria at noon.
I am looking for a job.
I have already been unemployed for a year.
There are too many unemployed people in this country.
