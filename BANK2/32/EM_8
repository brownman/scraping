An apple juice, please.
A lemonade, please.
A tomato juice, please.
I’d like a glass of red wine.
I’d like a glass of white wine.
I’d like a bottle of champagne.
Do you like fish?
Do you like beef?
Do you like pork?
I’d like something without meat.
I’d like some mixed vegetables.
I’d like something that won’t take much time.
Would you like that with rice?
Would you like that with pasta?
Would you like that with potatoes?
That doesn’t taste good.
The food is cold.
I didn’t order this.
