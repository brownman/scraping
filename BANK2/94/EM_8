I’m angry that you snore.
I’m angry that you drink so much beer.
I’m angry that you come so late.
I think he needs a doctor.
I think he is ill.
I think he is sleeping now.
We hope that he marries our daughter.
We hope that he has a lot of money.
We hope that he is a millionaire.
I heard that your wife had an accident.
I heard that she is in the hospital.
I heard that your car is completely wrecked.
I’m happy that you came.
I’m happy that you are interested.
I’m happy that you want to buy the house.
I’m afraid the last bus has already gone.
I’m afraid we will have to take a taxi.
I’m afraid I have no more money.
