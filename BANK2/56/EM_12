I want to buy a present.
But nothing too expensive.
Maybe a handbag?
Which color would you like?
Black, brown or white?
A large one or a small one?
May I see this one, please?
Is it made of leather?
Or is it made of plastic?
Of leather, of course.
This is very good quality.
And the bag is really very reasonable.
I like it.
I’ll take it.
Can I exchange it if needed?
Of course.
We’ll gift wrap it.
The cashier is over there.
