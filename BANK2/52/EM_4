It is hot today.
Shall we go to the swimming pool?
Do you feel like swimming?
Do you have a towel?
Do you have swimming trunks?
Do you have a bathing suit?
Can you swim?
Can you dive?
Can you jump in the water?
Where is the shower?
Where is the changing room?
Where are the swimming goggles?
Is the water deep?
Is the water clean?
Is the water warm?
I am freezing.
The water is too cold.
I am getting out of the water now.
